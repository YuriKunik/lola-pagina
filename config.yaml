      I am a Licenciate in Mathematical Science from the University of Buenos Aires, I did my thesis under the supervision of Ximena Fernández.

      I am currently researching applications of Morse Theory to TDA problems, more specifically, I am studying how to describe invariants of space filtrations using finite models and describing them with Morse Theory.

          In 2024 I began my doctoral studies, first thanks to a position as a full-time teaching assistant and, currently, with a CONICET doctoral scholarship.
        
          In my current research, I am exploring how discrete Morse Theory and finite models of spaces can be used to develop innovative methods for calculating homotopy invariants in filtrations of spaces.

          During 2021 and 2022 I was part of the Popularization Team of FCEyN-UBA. In this position I carried out mathematical dissemination workshops for secondary students and the general public, in addition to participating in vocational guidance talks. We also make videos talking about different topics which can be found on the [Popularization Team's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PopExactasUBAOficial).

          On the other hand, since 2019 I have actively participated as a collaborator in the Mathematics Week, annual event organized by the Department of Mathematics of FCEyN-UBA aimed at secondary students and the general public.

          I received my degree in mathematical sciences with a focus on pure mathematics in March 2024. During my degree I became particularly interested in topics of Topology, Algebra and Categories, taking specialized courses on these topics. In my thesis I studied TDA methods and applied them to the analysis of neuronal activity data from rats.
        
          Some of the codes used in the thesis are available in my GitHub repository.
